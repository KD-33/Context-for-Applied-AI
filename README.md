Links to scholarships that Gemini provided me
---
[The Women's Sports Foundation Billie Jean King Leadership Award](https://www.womenssportsfoundation.org/leadership-awards/)
-Tragically this link gave me a 404 error

[The National Federation of Business and Professional Women's (BPW) Foundation Scholarships](https://www.bpwfoundation.org/scholarships/)
-Tragically another 404 error

[The Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship](https://www.bpwfoundation.org/scholarships/)
-The link worked, but I don't meet the major criteria for the scholarship

[The Coca-Cola Scholars Foundation Scholarship](https://www.coca-colascholarsfoundation.org/)
-The link worked, but I am not a high schooler. I told Gemini that I was in college.

[The Morris K. Udall Scholarship and Excellence in National Environmental Policy Foundation](https://www.udall.gov/)
-The link worked and technically I could apply for this scholarship. 

Scholarships I found on my own that I may have AI help me apply to as case studies

## NEW MATERIAL FROM WEEK 2

[Scholarship Essay Rough Draft with Claude-3.5-Sonnet: Double Chat Window method](https://poe.com/s/AJDocViUnnh70iQeILxD)  
  -[Second Chat Window](https://poe.com/s/IbuQfjLMRZEBd6digDAk)  
  -Will need to edit a little further because it has a strong AI voice to it at the moment, but for the first time ever it went over the word limit that I asked for!! I asked for between 500-800 words and it wrote 863!  
[Scholarship Rough Draft with ChatGPT: All or Nothing method](https://chatgpt.com/share/9dd5e29c-2b92-4726-b47d-ee8674299e5b)  
  -Shockingly, on the first draft ChatGPT wrote 986 words when I only asked for 500-800! It's crazy to see how much AI has advanced just in the last few months.  

The two rough drafts from above will be added to my case study page on my repo. I am planning on having a few different case studies where I use each of my essay writing methods on one scholarship application at a time to showcase my writing methods strenghts and weaknesses on a level playing field. 

And then I also worked through some pages and added information that I wrote completely on my own (so it's possible you may find some grammatical errors, I haven't been through it with a fine-tooth comb yet)

## MATERIAL FROM WEEK 3
While I was traveling for cross country this week/weekend I focused on setting up my repo. There were a lot of uncertainties last week and I think I figured out all of my formatting hiccups. My repo is kinda cute now and I think it's laid out in a way that is quick to understand and navigate.

[outline creation link](https://chatgpt.com/share/66e7b3ff-47a8-800f-8a2e-b1f433782647)  
Currently Poe.com will not let me access any of my old chats (or create new ones) which is a bit troubling. So most of my work ended up being on ChatGPT, perplexity, and elicit this week. When I figure out the Poe.com thing, I will put those chats on next week.  
[Research for my pyschology project using Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/college-students-use-reusable-2IgzDUbrTDOPPsar5UpYBg)  
  -Very interesting because the topic I needed to find papers on was a bit  I was trying to make it correlate were a bit difficult. It took a lot of trial and error to get it to show me results that were semi useful.  
[Research for my pyschology project using Elicit](https://elicit.com/notebook/3cbc4ea4-981e-4c8d-a444-65aa397e984a)  
[Elicit not working as a scholarship finder](https://elicit.com/notebook/c77ebd2a-83c9-4da1-bb6f-89e7c4257025)  
  -I thought maybe, but no. It only brings up academic papers lol!
