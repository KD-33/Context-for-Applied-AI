Links to scholarships that Gemini provided me
---
[The Women's Sports Foundation Billie Jean King Leadership Award](https://www.womenssportsfoundation.org/leadership-awards/)
-Tragically this link gave me a 404 error

[The National Federation of Business and Professional Women's (BPW) Foundation Scholarships](https://www.bpwfoundation.org/scholarships/)
-Tragically another 404 error

[The Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship](https://www.bpwfoundation.org/scholarships/)
-The link worked, but I don't meet the major criteria for the scholarship

[The Coca-Cola Scholars Foundation Scholarship](https://www.coca-colascholarsfoundation.org/)
-The link worked, but I am not a high schooler. I told Gemini that I was in college.

[The Morris K. Udall Scholarship and Excellence in National Environmental Policy Foundation](https://www.udall.gov/)
-The link worked and technically I could apply for this scholarship. 

Scholarships I found on my own that I may have AI help me apply to as case studies
