Links to scholarships that Gemini provided me
---
[The Women's Sports Foundation Billie Jean King Leadership Award](https://www.womenssportsfoundation.org/leadership-awards/)
-Tragically this link gave me a 404 error

[The National Federation of Business and Professional Women's (BPW) Foundation Scholarships](https://www.bpwfoundation.org/scholarships/)
-Tragically another 404 error

[The Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship](https://www.bpwfoundation.org/scholarships/)
-The link worked, but I don't meet the major criteria for the scholarship

[The Coca-Cola Scholars Foundation Scholarship](https://www.coca-colascholarsfoundation.org/)
-The link worked, but I am not a high schooler. I told Gemini that I was in college.

[The Morris K. Udall Scholarship and Excellence in National Environmental Policy Foundation](https://www.udall.gov/)
-The link worked and technically I could apply for this scholarship. 

Scholarships I found on my own that I may have AI help me apply to as case studies

[Scholarship Essay Rough Draft with Claude-3.5-Sonnet: Double Chat Window method](https://poe.com/s/AJDocViUnnh70iQeILxD)  
  -[Second Chat Window](https://poe.com/s/IbuQfjLMRZEBd6digDAk)  
  -Will need to edit a little further because it has a strong AI voice to it at the moment, but for the first time ever it went over the word limit that I asked for!! I asked for between 500-800 words and it wrote 863!  
[Scholarship Rough Draft with ChatGPT: All or Nothing method](https://chatgpt.com/share/9dd5e29c-2b92-4726-b47d-ee8674299e5b)  
  -Shockingly, on the first draft ChatGPT wrote 986 words when I only asked for 500-800! It's crazy to see how much AI has advanced just in the last few months.  

The two rough drafts from above will be added to my case study page on my repo. 

And then I also worked through some pages and added information that I wrote completely on my own (so it's possible you may find some grammatical errors, I haven't been through it with a fine-tooth comb yet)
